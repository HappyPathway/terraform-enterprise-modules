## <a name="v201808-1"></a> v201808-1 (Aug 6, 2018)

APPLICATION LEVEL FEATURES:

1. Added a system email when a site admin is removed. This email is sent to all remaining site admins. 
1. Added settings that allow site admins to configure API rate limiting. By default, API rate limiting is enabled and limits clients to making 30 requests per second. However, by visiting the site admin and navigating to general settings, the global rate limit can be raised or disabled entirely. Due to the number of API requests Terraform Enterprise makes with regular use, the rate limit cannot be set lower than the default value of 30 requests per second. 
1. Added a download button for SAML metadata to the admin settings. An XML file is downloaded that can be imported into an identity provider. 
1. Changed link to module status page to always display if any module versions had ingress errors, instead of only when the latest version had ingress errors. 
1. Changed organization dropdown to simplify it. Organization settings are now linked at the top level. 
1. Changed webpage page titles for all pages to be unique. 
1. Added URL validation, to help prevent typos when adding VCS providers or setting up SAML authentication. 
1. Added ability to create state versions for a workspace using the v2 API. See API documentation for details. 
1. Added current state version as a relationship to workspaces in the API. See API documentation for details.

1. Changed the workspace "working directory" setting to be available even if no VCS integration is being used. 
1. Added a new site admin setting that allows customization of the support@hashicorp.com email address.
